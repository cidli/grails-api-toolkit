/* JSON API Object
*
* simple json object that can be defined outside of any application
* whose definition and rules can apply universally to request and
* response api object thus allowing interpretation/application of
* the object to happen in the application itself and enable definition
* to happen externally.
*
* This enables all definitions to be read in, applied, interpreted
* and used without tying them to any particular framework or language.
*
* KEYS
* 
* 'key':'self'(evaluates as LONG) > primary key, reference to self
* 'key':'table/domain reference'(evaluates as LONG) > foreign key and referenced table/domain
* 'key' : 'self or table/domain reference(STRING)' > index;reference to self,table or domain
*
* RULES:
*
* 'required' is data required from incoming request to validate api object for PUT and POST. defaults to FALSE
* 'expose' exposes to value to the service; in methods, only applies to keytypes. defaults to TRUE
* 'visible' makes data visible/invisible to user; in methods, only applies to keytypes. default to TRUE
* 'roles' allows you to set privileges on individual variables to return partial datasets. 'actions' 
*    can use this rule too but is not overridden; is considered a 'local' rule.
* 'mockData' allows you to set default data on the variable. This can be dynamic or static
*
* RULES GROUPS:
*
* 'actions' : default rules for each controller / action; value rule always override
*
* The override atomicity for rules is:
*
* action > value
* 
* with 'values' rules having the final override.
